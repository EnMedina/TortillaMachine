<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="1739" delta="old" >HDL ADVISOR - &quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">C:/SPB_Data/version-control/XilinxProjects/TortillaMachine/main.vhd</arg>&quot; line <arg fmt="%d" index="2">36</arg>: declaration of a buffer port will make it difficult for you to validate this design by simulation. It is preferable to declare it as output.

<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="647" delta="old" >Input &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">swAlarm</arg>&gt; is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2169" delta="old" >HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
